            Photographs are printed on Epson Doubleweight Matte Paper, certified Digigraphie ®, mounted in DIASEC ®, an exclusive and high quality proven face-mounting process. Prints are bonded directly and permanently to an Acrylic sheet, without borders. It eliminates thus the need for a frame and the print comes ready to hang.</p>
        <p class=\"mb-2 pr-sm-5 pr-lg-0\" data-zanim-xs='{\"delay\":0.3}'>
            This process enhances image clarity, definition and contrast, giving amazing subtleness to the mid-tones. It also insures prints a great stability and longevity, and Diasec's excellent conservation standards have made it very popular in museums and galleries.</p>
