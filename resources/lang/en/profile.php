    'content'=>'Black and white photography has been part of Sebastião’s life since his youth. That’s when, squatting the family’s bathroom, he learned the art of developing and printing. Since then, the camera is a lifetime companion, always at hand when the light calls. More than a hobby, photography is for him the chosen medium to register impressions and feelings, a sort of “visual log-book”. It took him some years - “a journey through the desert”, as he calls it - to adapt to digital and master again black and white photography. Sebastião lives near Sagres in southwestern Portugal, where he works as a skipper of Dolphin-watching boats. For over 45 years the sea has moulded his life and is definetly the main subject in his pictures.',
